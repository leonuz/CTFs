# CTF Competitions: What are they? 

Capture-the-Flag events are computer security competitions. Participants compete in security-themed challenges for the purpose of obtaining the highest score. Competitors are expected to “capture flags” to increase their score, hence the name of the event. Flags are usually random strings embedded in the challenges.

CTFs have increased in popularity as they attract a higher number of young talents each year. They help develop the essential skills required to follow a career path in cybersecurity.

These competitions can take many forms but the most common are Jeopardy and Attack-Defence. The report specifically focuses on these two types of CTF. An explanation and analysis is developed for each of them on the format, scoring, discussion and variants.

# Findings: what kind of analysis and methodology was used?

The themes used to qualitatively analyse CTF events were chosen with the objective to provide readers with sufficient information about all aspects of organising a CTF event. This analysis, therefore, explores the following elements of the competition in details:

> -   **entry requirements**: consolidates data on age, status, qualifications, location, etc.;
> -   **diversity and inclusion:**  gender balance, socio-economic background of or ethnic proportionate representation, etc.;
> -   **challenge format:**  explores challenge categories, scoring, platform used, prizes, length of the competition, etc.;
> -   **competition format**: analyses information on team sizes, mentors and coaches, qualifiers or parallel contests;
> -   **event organisation**: looks at other activities organised such as catering and transport or accommodation facilities provided;
> -   **post-event**  **actions**: explores actions performed after the event such as challenge and solution distribution, the release of result data or subsequent publications.

# Types of challenges in CTF events?

The thought of mastering all the infosec skills for participating in a CTF contest may look daunting. But you don’t have to master all the skills because a CTF event mainly includes the following challenges:

> - **Binary exploitation:** To solve these tasks, you need an in-depth knowledge of programming. You have to identify a vulnerability in a program and exploit it to take control of the shell or change the function of the program.  
> - **Cryptography:** These challenges involve converting strings from one format to another or encryption and decryption of ciphertexts to reach out to the flag.  
> - **Web Exploitation:** In these types of challenges, you have to exploit the target machine using exploitation methods such as SQL injection, buffer overflow, and cross-site scripting.  
> - **Reverse engineering:** In these types of challenges, reverse engineering knowledge is required to solve a particular problem. In reverse engineering, you have to convert a compiled code into an easy to comprehend format.  
> - **Forensics:** In these types of challenges, you will be asked to retrieve the executable or flag hidden in different types of files. For example, a flag may be hidden inside manipulated jpg images, registries, memory, and logs.  

# What are the main recommendations

Recommendations are provided in relation to the themes and areas explored. Formats for instance should be chosen according to the audience the competition is designed for. The accessibility and lower deployment costs of the Jeopardy format make it more suitable for non-professional participants. The Attack-Defence however, being more similar to wargame formats, is better suited to professional training exercises.

The report includes recommendations covering the following areas:

> - Team requirements;
> - Team sizes;
> - Scoring and rules;
> - Parallel competitions;
> - Challenge formats;
> - Communication and media;
> - Post-event.
