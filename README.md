# Capture The Flag (CTF)
If you are not familiar with the term **"CTF "** and all that this **WORLD** has to offer to the cybersecurity community, I recommend you read [this](ctf.md) first.

>There are a lot of Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions in our days, some of them have excelent tasks, but in most cases they're forgotten just after the CTF finished.  
[CTFTime](https://ctftime.org/) make some kind of CTF archive and a place, where you can get some another CTF-related info - current overall Capture The Flag team rating, per-team statistics etc.
